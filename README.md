# Java Script  

## Study Javascript language through making Momentum 


### Something I learn

#### Basic Knowledge
:white_check_mark:ECMAScript - Specification, manual

EX) ES5, ES6 == version of manual

:white_check_mark:Vanilla Javscript : Javascript without library (one type of js)
		    Javascript without makeup
		    JS provided to you on browser!!

:white_check_mark: All web browsers are Javascript installed! Powerful!

#### JS Grammar

:white_check_mark: JS grammar

- js should be inside in body!

:white_check_mark: JS Data

- Data types : let, var, const... (use const for default)

- Variable naming rule : camel case :) ex) lowerOfWeek (start with lower case)

- Organizing Data : Arrays / Object

##### Object 

label and Data

If the Object is const, we can change inside data

Can have array for data, or Array can have object

##### DOM

- Document Object Module

- JS takes all elements in HTML and turn them into Object!

:white_check_mark:MDN

- always find MDN when finding where the events come from.


#### Event Handler

:white_check_mark: JS is made to response to Events

- Events are anything that happens in website (ex. resize, click, closing ...)

- (EX) window.addEventListener("click",function{})

- When event happens, JS function is called and executed.
